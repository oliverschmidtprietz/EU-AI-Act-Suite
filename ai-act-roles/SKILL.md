  EU AI Act Role Determination — determines the organization's role (provider, deployer, importer, distributor, or quasi-provider) and assesses Art. 25 quasi-provider risk. This skill should be used when the user asks to "determine AI Act roles", "check if we are provider or deployer", "assess quasi-provider status", "check Art. 25 substantial modification", "check value chain responsibilities", or mentions "Betreiber", "Anbieter", "wesentliche Veränderung", or finetuning implications under the AI Act.

# EU AI Act Role Determination

Determine the organization's role under the **AI Act** (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) — provider (Anbieter), deployer (Betreiber), importer, distributor, or quasi-provider — and assess Art. 25 quasi-provider risk.

## Disclaimer (show at session start, do not block)

> **Important:** This skill provides structured AI Act role-determination guidance based on Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 and Commission value chain guidance. It is not legal advice. Final role determinations should involve qualified legal counsel with AI Act expertise.

## When to Search the Web

**On activation — search for:**
```
EU AI Act Commission guidance provider deployer roles value chain [current year]
EU AI Act Art. 25 substantial modification guidance latest
```

**For finetuning assessment — search for:**
```
EU AI Act finetuning substantial modification technical standards [current year]
EU AI Act open source model modification provider status
```

**For value chain obligations — search for:**
```
EU AI Act provider deployer responsibility allocation guidance [current year]
EU AI Act Art. 25(2) original provider support duty interpretation
```

## Workflow: Ask Questions ONE AT A TIME

### Phase 1: Context Gathering (Adaptive Intake)

**Prior Assessment Context (optional):**
> "If you have previously run another EU AI Act skill, you may paste the Assessment Context block here. This pre-fills several fields and avoids redundant input."

If context is provided, pre-populate applicable fields and skip to confirmation. If any field conflicts with user answers, flag the inconsistency.

**Batch 1 — Open-ended question (single prompt):**

> "Let's determine your organization's role under the EU AI Act."
>
> You can answer in your own words — a short paragraph or bullet points. I'll ask follow-up questions only if needed.
>
> **Describe your organization's relationship to this AI system:** how you obtained it, what you do with it, whether you've modified it, and how it reaches users.

**Coverage Analysis (internal — do not show this table to the user):**

After the user responds, silently extract these 4 fields from their natural-language answer:

| # | Field | Normalized values |
|---|-------|------------------|
| 1 | System acquisition | Self-developed · Commissioned · Purchased/licensed · Open-source · Third-party component |
| 2 | Organizational relationship | Developing for others · Deploying under own authority · Distributing · Importing · Integrating · Multiple |
| 3 | Market status | Already on EU market · First placement · First deployment · Already deployed |
| 4 | Modifications | None · Configuration · Finetuning/retraining · Changed purpose · Own brand · Substantial modification |

Apply generous extraction — e.g., "bought from US vendor" covers System acquisition (Purchased/licensed) + Market status (First placement) + potential Importer dimension. "We finetuned it and sell it under our brand" covers Modifications (Finetuning/retraining + Own brand) + Organizational relationship (Developing for others / Distributing).

**Batch 2 — Adaptive follow-up (only if needed):**

- If all 4 fields are clearly covered → skip Batch 2 entirely. Confirm extractions: "Based on your description, I've identified: [field summary]. Does this look correct?"
- If 1-2 fields are partially covered → confirm partial extractions: "You mentioned [X] — is this specifically [normalized value]?"
- If 2+ fields are missing → ask about gaps only: "A couple of details I still need: [specific missing fields]"
- Maximum 2 interaction turns for intake.

**Information Normalization (internal):**

Before proceeding to Phase 2, normalize all extracted information into the 4 structured fields above. If a field remains unclear after Batch 2, mark it as `[UNCLEAR — proceeding with cautious assumptions]` and note which assumption was made.

### Phase 2: Primary Role Determination

Read [references/role-definitions.md](references/role-definitions.md) for full legal definitions.

Apply the decision tree through Art. 3(3)-(7):

```
ROLE DETERMINATION DECISION TREE

System acquisition + Organizational relationship → Role mapping:

Develops or commissions development + places on market/puts into service
  under own name/trademark?
  └─ YES → PROVIDER (Anbieter) — Art. 3(3)

Uses AI system under own authority in professional capacity?
  └─ YES → DEPLOYER (Betreiber) — Art. 3(4)

Imports AI system from third country to place on EU market?
  └─ YES → IMPORTER (Einführer) — Art. 3(6)

Makes AI system available on EU market (not as provider/importer)?
  └─ YES → DISTRIBUTOR (Händler) — Art. 3(7)

Integrates AI system into product as manufacturer?
  └─ YES → Product manufacturer — Art. 25(3), treated as PROVIDER
```

**Multiple roles:** An organization can hold multiple roles simultaneously (e.g., provider of one system and deployer of another). Assess each system separately.

**Output after primary role determination:**

> "Based on your answers, your primary role appears to be **[Role]** under Art. 3([X]) AI Act.
> [Brief reasoning based on answers]"

### Phase 3: Quasi-Provider Risk Assessment (Art. 25)

**Only proceed with this phase if:**
1. The system is high-risk, AND
2. The user is not already classified as the original provider

Read [references/quasi-provider-scenarios.md](references/quasi-provider-scenarios.md) and [references/substantial-modification.md](references/substantial-modification.md).

> "I will now assess whether your organization could be treated as a new provider under Art. 25 ('quasi-provider'). This applies when certain modifications or actions cause a deployer, distributor, or importer to assume provider obligations."

**Scenario 1 — Own Name/Brand — Art. 25(1)(a):**
> "Have you put your own name, trademark, or brand on the AI system, or do you present it to end users under your own branding?"

If YES → **quasi-provider under Art. 25(1)(a)**. Organization assumes full provider obligations.

**Scenario 2 — Substantial Modification — Art. 25(1)(b):**
> "Have you made a substantial modification (wesentliche Veränderung) to the AI system?"

Read [references/substantial-modification.md](references/substantial-modification.md) for the 3-step checklist.

Apply the 3-step determination:

**Step 1: Identify the change**
> "What specific changes were made to the AI system? (technical parameters, data, architecture, deployment context)"

**Step 2: Assess foreseeability**
> "Were these changes foreseen or covered in the original provider's conformity assessment or intended purpose documentation?"

**Step 3: Evaluate risk impact**
> "Did the changes affect compliance with requirements in Chapter III, Section 2 (Art. 8-15), or did they alter the system's risk profile?"

If finetuning is involved → apply graduated assessment from [references/finetuning-assessment.md](references/finetuning-assessment.md):

| Finetuning Level | Risk of Substantial Modification |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| PEFT/Adapter (LoRA, QLoRA) | Low — typically does not constitute substantial modification |
| Layer-wise finetuning | Medium — may constitute substantial modification depending on scope |
| Full model retraining | High — likely constitutes substantial modification |

**Scenario 3 — Changed Intended Purpose — Art. 25(1)(c):**
> "Have you changed the intended purpose (Zweckbestimmung) of the AI system from what the original provider specified?"

If YES → **quasi-provider under Art. 25(1)(c)**. A change of intended purpose always triggers provider status for the entity that changed the purpose.

**Scenarios 4-5 — Product Manufacturer Integration — Art. 25(3)(a-b):**
> "Are you a product manufacturer who:"
> - "(a) places on the market or puts into service a high-risk AI system together with your product under your own name or trademark?"
> - "(b) puts into service a high-risk AI system bearing your name or trademark after it has already been placed on the market?"

If YES to either → provider obligations apply to the product manufacturer.

**Art. 25(4) Exception:**
> "Were the changes you made already foreseen and covered in the original provider's conformity assessment?"

If YES → Art. 25(4) applies — the original conformity assessment remains valid, and Art. 25(1)(b) does not trigger quasi-provider status.

## Critical Reminders

1. **An organization can be both provider and deployer** — for different systems or even the same system in different contexts
2. **Art. 25 quasi-provider is a trap** — many organizations unknowingly become providers through finetuning or rebranding
3. **Art. 25(2) mutual support obligation** — even when quasi-provider status triggers, the original provider must cooperate and provide technical documentation
4. **Intended purpose is the key anchor** — any change from the provider's documented intended purpose triggers Art. 25(1)(c)
5. **Configuration ≠ modification** — using a system within the provider's intended configuration range does not constitute substantial modification
6. **Open-source models** — downloading and deploying an open-source model under own brand likely triggers Art. 25(1)(a)
7. **Search for latest guidance** — the Commission is expected to publish detailed Art. 25 guidance
8. **Jurisdiction-specific employment law** — role determination has national employment law implications. Reference [references/employment-law-overlay.md](references/employment-law-overlay.md) Section 3 for per-country works council requirements (DE: BetrVG, AT: ArbVG, FR: Code du Travail, NL: WOR, IT: Statuto dei Lavoratori, ES: Ley Rider) that apply in addition to AI Act role obligations
9. **Compliance timeline** — reference [references/compliance-deadlines.md](references/compliance-deadlines.md) for applicable deadlines based on role and risk tier
