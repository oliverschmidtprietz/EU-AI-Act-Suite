# EU AI Act Obligations Mapper

Map the full set of legal obligations based on **role + risk tier** under the AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689), producing an actionable compliance matrix with RACI assignments and implementation priorities.

## Disclaimer (show at session start, do not block)

> **Important:** This skill provides structured AI Act obligations guidance based on the EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689). It is not legal advice. Implementation of compliance measures should involve qualified legal counsel and relevant technical experts. Effective dates for high-risk obligations reflect the AI Omnibus 2026 postponement (Annex III: 2 December 2027; Annex I: 2 August 2028).

## Workflow: Ask Questions ONE AT A TIME

### Phase 1: Input Context (Context-Aware Adaptive Intake)

**Step 1 — Context detection (always first):**

> "Let's map your AI Act obligations."
>
> If you've run prior AI Act skills (/ai-act-classifier, /ai-act-roles, /ai-act-quick), paste the Assessment Context block below. Otherwise, describe your situation in your own words.

**Step 2 — Coverage analysis (internal — do not show this table to the user):**

Map the context block or narrative to these 6 fields:

| # | Field | Source in context block | Fallback |
|---|-------|----------------------|----------|
| 1 | Risk classification | "Classification:" line | Ask |
| 2 | Organizational role | "Role:" line | Ask |
| 3 | Organization size | "Org Size:" line | Ask |
| 4 | Sector | "Sector:" line | Ask |
| 5 | Jurisdiction(s) | "Jurisdiction:" line | Ask |
| 6 | Existing frameworks | Not in context block | Always ask |

If the user needs classification help → suggest running /ai-act-classifier first.
If the role hasn't been determined yet → suggest running /ai-act-roles first.

**Step 3 — Adaptive follow-up:**

- If context block provided → confirm extracted fields, then ask only about gaps. Fields 1-5 are typically covered; only field 6 (existing frameworks) needs asking.
- If narrative provided → extract what's covered, ask about remaining gaps in a single grouped question.
- If minimal information provided → ask about all missing fields in a single prompt, grouped conversationally.

Existing compliance status is always asked since it's new information not carried in the context block. Frame conversationally:

> "One more thing — which compliance foundations do you already have in place? (Risk management, data quality, QMS, DPIA, incident reporting, AI literacy training, or starting from scratch)"

Maximum 2 interaction turns for intake. If a field remains unclear, mark as `[UNCLEAR — proceeding with cautious assumptions]`.

### Phase 2: Obligation Mapping

Based on role + risk tier, load the applicable obligation set.

Read the relevant reference files:

**Deployer + High-Risk** → Read [references/high-risk-deployer-obligations.md](references/high-risk-deployer-obligations.md)
**Provider + High-Risk** → Read [references/high-risk-provider-obligations.md](references/high-risk-provider-obligations.md)
**Any role + Low-Risk/Minimal** → Read [references/low-risk-obligations.md](references/low-risk-obligations.md)
**Non-high-risk Annex III (Art. 6(3) exception)** → Read [references/art6-4-documentation.md](references/art6-4-documentation.md)
**GPAI provider** → Read [references/gpai-obligations.md](references/gpai-obligations.md)
**FRIA-triggering deployer** → Read [references/fria-template.md](references/fria-template.md) for Art. 27 FRIA methodology and fillable template
**Provider conformity assessment** → Read [references/conformity-assessment.md](references/conformity-assessment.md) for Art. 43 track selection, EU Declaration, and CE marking
**Provider post-market monitoring** → Read [references/post-market-monitoring.md](references/post-market-monitoring.md) for Art. 72 monitoring system design and serious incident reporting
**EU database registration** → Read [references/eu-database-registration.md](references/eu-database-registration.md) for Art. 49 registration process (provider and deployer tracks)
**All roles** → Art. 4 AI competence obligation always applies

**Obligation count preview:**

> "Based on your role as **[Role]** of a **[risk tier]** system, you have **N obligations** across K categories. I'll walk through them in 4 batches."

**Batched assessment (4 batches replacing per-obligation questioning):**

Present obligations grouped by category. For each batch, show a table with all obligations in that category and ask the user to respond to the entire batch at once:

| Batch | Category | Typical obligations |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Technical Measures | Use per instructions, monitoring, input data, log retention, data quality |
| 2 | Organizational Measures | Oversight persons, inform affected persons, employee info, AI competence, incident reporting, registration, authority cooperation |
| 3 | Management Systems | Risk management, data quality mgmt, QMS, post-market monitoring |
| 4 | Impact Assessments | DPIA, FRIA |

For each batch, present a table:

> **Batch [X] of 4: [Category]**
>
> | # | Obligation | Legal Basis | Priority | Status |
> |---|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
> | 1 | [obligation] | [article] | [Immediate/Short-term/Ongoing] | Already in place / Partially addressed / Not yet addressed |
>
> "For each obligation, indicate: already in place, partially addressed, or not yet addressed. You can respond with just the numbers (e.g., '1,3 = in place; 2,4 = partial; 5 = not addressed')."

**Progress indicator** after each batch: "Batch [X] of 4 complete. [N] obligations remaining."

**Smart defaults:** If the user indicated "starting from scratch" in Phase 1, default all obligations to "not yet addressed" and confirm: "Since you're starting from scratch, I've marked all obligations as not yet addressed. Any exceptions?"

Target: 4-5 interaction turns instead of 20+.

Flag priority levels: **critical timeline obligations first** (e.g., Art. 26(6) 6-month log retention must be operational from day one).

#### GDPR Cross-Reference Checks

Read [references/gdpr-crosswalk.md](references/gdpr-crosswalk.md).

At relevant obligation points, suggest existing GDPR skills:

| Obligation | Trigger | Suggestion |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Art. 26(9) DPIA | High-risk deployer | "Perform a DPIA incorporating the provider's Art. 13 information about system capabilities and limitations" |
| Art. 26(11) inform affected persons | Deployer transparency | "Prepare a combined AI Act/GDPR transparency notice covering Art. 26(11) and Art. 13/14 GDPR" |
| Art. 10 data governance | Provider data quality | "Conduct a data inventory review mapping AI training data against GDPR data quality and minimization principles" |
| Art. 26(7) employee information | Workplace AI | "Prepare employee AI transparency documentation combining Art. 26(7) and GDPR Art. 13/14 requirements" |
| Art. 26(5) serious incidents | Incident detected | "Establish a dual incident reporting procedure covering both AI Act (Art. 73) and GDPR (Art. 33/34) timelines" |
| Personal data processing | Any AI processing personal data | "Review your GDPR Art. 28 processor agreement to include AI Act cooperation provisions (Art. 25(2))" |

## Critical Reminders

1. **Art. 4 AI competence applies to ALL roles and ALL risk tiers** — even minimal risk systems
2. **Art. 26(6) log retention (6 months)** — must be in place from day one of deployment
3. **Art. 26(9) DPIA** — must be completed BEFORE deployment, not after
4. **Art. 27 FRIA** — required for public bodies, private entities providing public services, and deployers of insurance risk assessment (Annex III Nr. 5(b)) and social benefits eligibility (Annex III Nr. 5(c)) systems
5. **Art. 26(5) incident reporting** — "without undue delay" to provider and authority
6. **SME proportionality** — Art. 62 requires authorities to consider SME capabilities
7. **Transition periods vary** — prohibited practices (Feb 2025), GPAI (Aug 2025), high-risk Annex III (**Dec 2027** — Omnibus-postponed from Aug 2026), high-risk Annex I (**Aug 2028** — Omnibus-postponed from Aug 2027). See `../ai-act-high-risk/references/ai-omnibus-timeline-postponements.md` for the citation chain.
8. **Search for latest harmonized standards** — technical implementation standards are still being developed
9. **Enforcement exposure** — consult the ai-act-classifier skill's `references/enforcement-framework.md` for penalty tiers (up to €35M / 7% turnover for Art. 5 violations, €15M / 3% for other infringements), enforcement architecture, and practical risk assessment factors
10. **Jurisdiction-specific obligations** — reference [references/regulatory-overlays.md](references/regulatory-overlays.md) for per-country employment law, financial regulator, and data protection overlay requirements that apply in addition to AI Act obligations
11. **Compliance timeline & resources** — reference [references/compliance-roadmap.md](references/compliance-roadmap.md) for quarterly action calendar, resource estimation by organization size, and phased compliance roadmap template
