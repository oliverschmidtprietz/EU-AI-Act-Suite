# EU AI Act Obligations Mapper — Deployment Guide

> 📄 **[View the interactive skill page →](https://oliverschmidtprietz.github.io/EU-AI-Act-Suite/ai-act-obligations/)**

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

## Overview

EU AI Act Obligations Mapper — produces an actionable compliance matrix for a given role + risk tier:

- **Role × tier obligation matrix** — provider, deployer, importer, distributor across prohibited, high-risk, GPAI, Art. 50, minimal
- **RACI assignments** for each obligation (Responsible / Accountable / Consulted / Informed)
- **Implementation priorities** sequenced against compliance deadlines
- **Technical measures** — risk management, data governance, logging, transparency, human oversight, accuracy/robustness, cybersecurity
- **Organisational measures** — quality management, post-market monitoring, incident reporting, conformity assessment
- **Management systems** — what is required (e.g., Art. 17 QMS) vs. recommended
- **Impact assessments** required (DPIA, FRIA, conformity assessment) with cross-references
- **GDPR crosswalk** — overlap and interplay between AI Act and GDPR obligations
- **Regulatory overlays** — sector-specific layers (banking, medical devices, employment)
- **Art. 6(4) documentation** support for Art. 6(3)-exception users
- **EU database registration** workflow for Annex III high-risk systems
- **Compliance roadmap** with priority decision tree

## Deployment

### Claude.ai (User Skills)

1. Go to **Settings → Profile → Custom Skills** (or equivalent)
2. Upload the entire `ai-act-obligations/` folder structure
3. The skill will auto-trigger when you ask to map obligations, build a compliance checklist, or assess provider/deployer duties under the AI Act

### Claude Code / Custom MCP Setup

1. Copy the `ai-act-obligations/` folder to your skills directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r ai-act-obligations/ /path/to/your/skills/user/ai-act-obligations/
   ```
2. Ensure the skill is registered in your configuration

## Usage

### Quick Start

Tell the skill your role and risk tier (or just describe the system):

> "We're the deployer of a high-risk AI system used for credit scoring in
> Germany. What obligations do we have, and what should we prioritise in
> the first 6 months?"

The skill will produce a tailored obligation matrix with RACI and priorities.

### Trigger Phrases

- "Map AI Act obligations" / "Check what we need to do" / "Compliance checklist"
- "Deployer obligations" / "Provider duties" / "Art. 26" / "Art. 16-17"
- "AI literacy Art. 4" / "DPIA" / "FRIA" / "fundamental rights assessment"
- "Pflichtenkatalog"

### Workflow

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Phase 1: Input Context** | Context-aware adaptive intake — role, risk tier, sector, jurisdiction; consumes prior skill output if provided |
| **Phase 2: Obligation Mapping** | Tier-specific obligation list with priority decision tree |
| **Phase 3: Implementation Roadmap** | Sequenced plan against deadlines with quick-win identification |
| **Phase 4: Obligations Matrix Output** | RACI-tagged matrix: technical measures, organisational measures, management systems, impact assessments, GDPR cross-refs |
