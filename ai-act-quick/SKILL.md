# EU AI Act Quick Assessment

Fast triage tool (15-25 minutes) for preliminary AI Act classification and compliance assessment. Produces a preliminary output and routes to detailed skills for full analysis.

## Disclaimer (show at session start, do not block)

> **Important:** This is a preliminary AI Act assessment based on Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, designed for rapid triage. It is not legal advice and does not replace a full assessment — validate results using the detailed skills (ai-act-classifier, ai-act-high-risk for Art. 6 depth, ai-act-roles, ai-act-obligations, ai-act-report) and qualified legal counsel. Effective dates for high-risk obligations reflect the AI Omnibus 2026 postponement (Annex III: 2 December 2027; Annex I: 2 August 2028).

## Who this is for, and what kind of work this is

**Operator.** This triage can be run by a **non-lawyer — a product owner, compliance manager, or founder scoping AI Act exposure** — as well as by counsel. That is exactly why the output is preliminary by construction: if you are not a lawyer, your job is to **route the resulting card to qualified counsel**, not to treat "Likely Minimal" as an all-clear. No special AI fluency is assumed beyond describing the system in plain language.

**Work shape.** This is **bounded-transactional triage**: a single system run once through a fixed 6-gate sequence to produce a directional classification card — fast, pattern-matched, and deliberately shallow. It is the *opening* move of an accretive workflow, not the conclusion: a plausible high-risk or prohibited branch is meant to escalate into the full Art. 6 assessment and counsel, never to stop at the card. The speed is bought by narrowing scope, and the skill stays inside that narrow scope.

## Quick Assessment Workflow

### Phase 1: Quick Context (Adaptive 2-Batch Flow)

Gather context through a conversational 2-batch approach. Maximum 2 interaction turns — 1 if the user is detailed, 2 if gaps remain.

#### Batch 1: Essential Questions (always asked)

Present these three questions with a natural, conversational welcome:

> **Let's get started with a quick EU AI Act assessment.**
>
> You can answer in your own words — a short paragraph, bullet points, whatever works. I'll ask follow-up questions only if I need more detail.
>
> **1. What does the AI system do?** (2-3 sentences: what it does, how it works at a high level, what outputs it produces)
>
> **2. Where is the system deployed?** (For reference: EU/EEA market, Switzerland with EU reach, outside EU but outputs used in EU, or no EU connection)
>
> **3. What is your organization's relationship to it?** (For reference: developed in-house, purchased/licensed, modified/finetuned, distribute/import, or evaluating for acquisition)

#### Coverage Analysis (internal — not shown to user)

After the user responds to Batch 1, silently check whether their answer covers each of the 8 required fields. Be generous with extraction — e.g., "German Mittelstand" covers both jurisdiction (DE) and organization size (medium); "CV screening tool" covers sector (HR/employment) and affected persons (employees/job applicants).

| # | Field | Extract from |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | System description | Batch 1 Q1 |
| 2 | Deployment context | Batch 1 Q2 |
| 3 | Organization role | Batch 1 Q3 |
| 4 | Sector | Often inferable from system description |
| 5 | Affected persons | Often inferable from system description + sector |
| 6 | Modifications | Often inferable from organization role |
| 7 | Organization size | Sometimes mentioned in context |
| 8 | Jurisdiction(s) | Often inferable from deployment context |

Mark each field: **Covered** / **Partially covered** / **Not covered**.

#### Batch 2: Adaptive Follow-Up (only if gaps remain)

- **All 8 fields covered** → Skip Batch 2. Briefly confirm your extractions and proceed to Phase 2.
- **Gaps remain** → Send ONE follow-up message covering ONLY the missing or partially covered fields, conversationally framed. Do not re-ask what was already answered.
- **Partially covered fields** → Use confirmation prompts, not full re-asks. Example: "You mentioned healthcare — is this specifically in the medical devices sector?"
- **Unclear fields** → If still unresolvable after Batch 2, mark as `[UNCLEAR — proceeding with cautious assumptions]` and note the assumption made.

Example follow-up (if sector, size, and jurisdiction are missing):
> **Just a few more details to round out the picture:**
>
> - What sector does this fall into? (e.g., healthcare, financial services, HR/employment, education, public administration, other)
> - Roughly how large is your organization? (e.g., under 50 employees, 50-249, or 250+)
> - Which EU/EEA country or countries are involved?

#### Information Normalization (internal — before Phase 2)

Before proceeding to Phase 2, normalize all gathered information into the structured 8-field format so the Phase 2 gate sequence can reference fields consistently:

1. **System description** — free text
2. **Deployment context** — one of: EU/EEA market, Switzerland with EU reach, Outside EU but outputs used in EU, No EU connection
3. **Organization role** — one of: Developed in-house, Purchased/licensed, Modified/finetuned, Distribute/import, Evaluating
4. **Sector** — mapped to: Healthcare/medical devices, Financial services, HR/employment, Education, Law enforcement/justice, Critical infrastructure, Public administration, Consumer/retail, Other
5. **Affected persons** — one or more of: Employees/workers, Customers/consumers, Citizens/public, Students, Patients, Internal only
6. **Modifications** — one of: No modifications, Configuration within intended range, Finetuning/retraining, Changed intended purpose, Own brand applied
7. **Organization size** — one of: Micro (<10), Small (10-49), Medium (50-249), Large (250+)
8. **Jurisdiction(s)** — list of EU/EEA Member States or Switzerland

### Phase 2: Rapid Classification (6-Step Gate Sequence)

Read [references/quick-decision-tree.md](references/quick-decision-tree.md) for the condensed classification logic.

Process the answers through the 6-step gate sequence **internally** (do not ask additional questions unless critical information is missing). Output the result as a single assessment.

**Gate 1: Scope Check (Art. 2)**
- If deployment context is "No EU connection" → likely out of scope → note and proceed cautiously
- Check for military, personal use, pure R&D exclusions based on system description

**Gate 2: AI System Test (Art. 3(1))**
- Quick determination based on system description
- Apply simplified 3-question test: (1) machine-based? (2) infers/generates beyond rules? (3) influences environment?

**Gate 3: Prohibited Practice Screen (Art. 5)**
- Rapid screen based on system description and sector
- Flag any potential Art. 5 concern for detailed review

**Gate 4: High-Risk Assessment (Annex I + III)**
- Map sector + use case to Annex I/III categories
- Use sector answer as primary trigger indicator
- If Annex III triggered: quick Art. 6(3) exception check
- For full Art. 6 high-risk depth assessment (Commission Guidelines-grounded), route to **`ai-act-high-risk`** after triage if the high-risk branch is plausible.

**Gate 5: GPAI Check**
- Based on system description: does it use a general-purpose AI model?
- If yes: note GPAI obligations

**Gate 6: Transparency Triggers (Art. 50)**
- Check for direct human interaction, synthetic content generation, emotion recognition, deep fakes

### Confidence — three bands, three behaviors

The `Confidence` field in the output is not decorative. Each level changes what you do with the determination, so an ambiguous call never reads the same as a clear one:

- **High** — the gates land cleanly on the facts given → **proceed**: present the card as a confident preliminary, with the normal "validate before compliance decisions" caveat.
- **Medium** — the classification turns on an assumption or a field marked partially covered → **surface and ask**: state the determination, but name the specific assumption it rests on and put the open question to the user rather than smoothing it over.
- **Low** — key facts are missing, the system sits on a risk-tier boundary, or an Art. 5 / Annex III branch is plausible but unconfirmed → **hand back**: lead with the uncertainty, flag the higher risk tier as the working assumption, and make escalation to the full assessment and counsel the headline, not a footnote.

When in doubt between two bands, pick the lower one.

### Phase 4: Template Offer (Optional)

After presenting the preliminary assessment, offer:

> "Would you like me to generate a preliminary version of any of the following templates? These will be marked as preliminary and should be finalized after running the full assessment skills."
>
> 1. **Classification Record (Prüfprotokoll)** — preliminary audit trail
> 2. **Compliance Register Entry** — preliminary obligation tracker
> 3. **Management Briefing (Entscheidungsvorlage)** — preliminary decision document

If requested, use the templates from [/ai-act-report/references/output-templates.md] and mark all outputs prominently as "PRELIMINARY — Full assessment recommended."

## Critical Reminders

1. **This is a triage tool** — always recommend running detailed skills for compliance decisions
2. **"Likely" is not "confirmed"** — preliminary determinations require validation
3. **Err on the side of caution** — if uncertain between risk tiers, flag the higher risk tier as possible
4. **Flag uncertainty explicitly** — the Confidence band drives behavior: High → proceed, Medium → surface the assumption and ask, Low → lead with the uncertainty and hand back (see *Confidence — three bands, three behaviors*)
5. **National requirements matter** — always flag jurisdiction-specific obligations using [references/jurisdiction-flags.md]
6. **Compliance timeline** — reference [references/compliance-deadlines.md] for deadline urgency
7. **Enforcement exposure** — reference [/ai-act-classifier/references/enforcement-framework.md] for penalty context
