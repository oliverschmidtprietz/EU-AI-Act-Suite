# EU AI Act Examination Report Generator

Generate a formal, structured AI Act compliance assessment report (Dokumentierter Pruefbericht) suitable for legal files, audit trails, and regulatory inquiries under Regulation (EU) 2024/1689.

## Disclaimer (show at session start, do not block)

> **Important:** This skill produces structured AI Act report templates based on Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. It is not legal advice. Reports should be reviewed and validated by qualified legal counsel before regulatory use. Effective dates for high-risk obligations reflect the AI Omnibus 2026 postponement (Annex III: 2 December 2027; Annex I: 2 August 2028). When report templates reference compliance deadlines, use the Omnibus-postponed values.

## When to Search the Web

**Before report generation — search for:**
```
EU AI Act latest Commission guidance enforcement decisions [current year]
EU AI Act [relevant sector] specific guidance [current year]
```

**For legal citation verification — search for:**
```
EU AI Act Regulation 2024/1689 consolidated text corrigenda [current year]
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Input Collection (Context-First Adaptive Intake)

**Step 1 — Context detection:**

> "Let's generate your AI Act compliance report."
>
> If you've run prior AI Act skills in this conversation, I can extract the outputs. Otherwise, paste your Assessment Context block or describe your situation.

**Step 2 — Coverage analysis (internal — do not show this table to the user):**

Extract up to 11 fields from prior context or narrative:

| # | Field | Source |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | System name | Context block "System:" or description |
| 2 | Version | Description or context |
| 3 | Provider/vendor | Description or context |
| 4 | Technology type | Description (ML, NLP, CV, etc.) |
| 5 | Deployment context | Description or prior skill outputs |
| 6 | Data types processed | Description |
| 7 | Integration level | Description (standalone, integrated, API-based) |
| 8 | Organization name | Context block or description |
| 9 | Sector | Context block "Sector:" line |
| 10 | Role | Context block "Role:" line |
| 11 | Jurisdiction / Org size | Context block lines |

If an Assessment Context block is provided, auto-populate all available fields, confirm extractions, and ask only about gaps.

If no prior skill outputs are available — gather essential inputs conversationally:

> "I'll need some details about the AI system and your organization. You can answer in your own words — a paragraph or bullet points covering: what the system does, who built it, how it's used, your organization's name and sector, and where you operate in the EU."

Extract fields from the response. Ask about remaining gaps in a single follow-up.

**Step 3 — Report-specific fields (always asked, since they're unique to the report):**

> "A few report-specific details:"
> - Client/matter reference (optional)
> - Prepared by (name/role)
> - Date of assessment

Maximum 2 interaction turns for intake. If a field remains unclear, mark as `[UNCLEAR — to be confirmed]`.

### Phase 1.5: Input Validation

Before generating the report, cross-check stated inputs for consistency:

**Classification Cross-Check:**
If stated risk tier is "minimal" or "limited" but system description mentions:
- Recruitment, CV screening, performance evaluation → flag as potentially high-risk — Annex III Nr. 4 (Employment): recruitment, screening, evaluation, or termination
- Credit scoring, insurance risk assessment → flag as potentially high-risk — Annex III Nr. 5 (Essential services): credit scoring, insurance, or benefit eligibility
- Medical diagnosis, patient triage → flag as potentially high-risk — medical AI under Annex I (product safety) or Annex III Nr. 5
- Biometric identification → flag as potentially high-risk — Annex III Nr. 1 (Biometrics): identification or categorization
- Student assessment, admissions → flag as potentially high-risk — Annex III Nr. 3 (Education): assessment or admissions
- Benefits eligibility → flag as potentially high-risk — Annex III Nr. 5(c) (Social benefits): eligibility evaluation
→ If flag: "⚠ Classification inconsistency: [concern]. Please confirm or re-run /ai-act-classifier."

**Role Cross-Check:**
- If "deployer" but description mentions "we developed/built/proprietary" → flag provider
- If "deployer" but description mentions own brand, modified purpose, significant retraining → flag quasi-provider
→ If flag: "⚠ Role inconsistency: [concern]. Please confirm or re-run /ai-act-roles."

**Completeness Cross-Check:**
- High-risk stated but no DPIA mentioned → flag "DPIA required (Art. 26(9))"
- FRIA-triggering category but no FRIA mentioned → flag "FRIA required (Art. 27)"

Proceed to Phase 2 after validation confirmed or flags acknowledged.

---

### Phase 2: Report Generation

**Template Selection:**

> "Which output format would you like?"
> - (a) **Full Assessment Report** — comprehensive report following the standard template (default)
> - (b) **Classification Record (Prüfprotokoll)** — formal audit trail for the classification decision
> - (c) **Compliance Register Entry** — living compliance tracking document for GRC integration
> - (d) **Management Briefing (Entscheidungsvorlage)** — 2-page decision document for board/C-level
> - (e) **Multiple** — generate more than one format

For templates (b), (c), (d): Read [references/output-templates.md](references/output-templates.md) for the template structures, quality checklists, and when-to-use guidance.

For template (a) — the full assessment report:

Read [references/report-template.md](references/report-template.md) for the full template structure.
Read [references/legal-citations-index.md](references/legal-citations-index.md) for citation accuracy.
Read [references/interpretation-aids.md](references/interpretation-aids.md) for assessment frameworks.
Read [references/case-studies.md](references/case-studies.md) for sample report excerpts (high-risk, Art. 6(3) exception, minimal risk).

```

---

### Phase 3: Quality Check

After generating the report, verify:

1. **Citation completeness:** Every legal determination has an article reference
2. **Reasoning documented:** Each Yes/No determination includes reasoning
3. **Flags raised:** All areas requiring human legal judgment are explicitly flagged
4. **GDPR cross-references:** Applicable GDPR obligations are identified
5. **Follow-up actions:** Clear next steps are specified
6. **Limitations stated:** Any uncertainties or information gaps are documented

Suggest follow-up actions:
- DPIA per Art. 35 GDPR if not yet completed
- Obligation implementation tracking
- Periodic reassessment schedule
- Legal counsel review of flagged areas

---

### Phase 4: Word Document Export (Optional)

**Note:** This phase requires Claude Code (CLI) with file system access. It is not available on claude.ai or mobile.

After Phase 3 Quality Check is complete, offer the Word document export:

> "Would you like me to also export this as a professionally formatted Word document (.docx)?"

If the user declines or the environment does not support file generation → skip this phase.

If yes:

**Prerequisite:** The `docx-processing-anthropic` skill must be installed at `~/.claude/skills/docx-processing-anthropic/`. If the skill directory does not exist, inform the user: "Word document export requires the docx-processing skill. Install it first, then re-run this phase."

**Step 1 — Confirm details:**
> "I'll generate a Word document. Where should I save it?"

Default: current working directory. Use the naming convention: `AI-Act-[Template]-[SystemName]-[YYYY-MM-DD].docx`

**Step 2 — Generate the document:**

Read [references/docx-formatting.md](references/docx-formatting.md) for styling specifications, typography, table formatting, cover page structure, and per-template structural guidance.

Read the docx-js API reference from the docx-processing skill (`~/.claude/skills/docx-processing-anthropic/references/docx-js.md`) for the full library API and critical formatting rules.

Generate a JavaScript file that:
1. Creates a cover page (own section, no header/footer) with report type, system name, metadata, and disclaimer
2. Adds a Table of Contents (except for Management Briefing template)
3. Converts all report sections using the heading hierarchy (H1 → HeadingLevel.HEADING_1, etc.)
4. Renders all assessment tables with consistent styling (light gray header rows, thin gray borders)
5. Adds headers (report title + date) and footers ("Confidential" + page numbers) on all pages except cover
6. Includes the disclaimer as final paragraph

Run the JavaScript file to produce the .docx. Verify the file was created successfully.

**Step 3 — Confirm delivery:**
> "Word document saved to: `[file path]`"

---

## Critical Reminders

1. **This report is a documentation aid** — it does not replace legal judgment on complex classification questions
2. **Flag uncertainty honestly** — marking "Possibly" is better than forcing a wrong determination
3. **Include all search results** — if web search revealed new guidance, cite it in the methodology section
4. **Art. 6(4) documentation requirement** — providers of Annex III systems classified as non-high-risk under Art. 6(3) must document their assessment before placing on market (Art. 6(4)). This includes documenting which condition (a)-(d) is met, the harm assessment, and confirming no profiling. Consult the ai-act-obligations skill's `references/art6-4-documentation.md` for the full template
5. **Version control** — include date and version; reassess when circumstances change
6. **Dual language terms** — preserve German legal terms alongside English for EU legal context
7. **Include compliance timeline** — reference [references/compliance-timeline.md](references/compliance-timeline.md) for applicable deadlines, quarterly action calendar, and phased compliance roadmap in Section 8 (Recommendations)
8. **Jurisdiction-specific recommendations** — reference [references/jurisdiction-checklists.md](references/jurisdiction-checklists.md) for per-country compliance checklists and employment law overlay when generating recommendations
9. **Enforcement context** — consult the ai-act-classifier skill's `references/enforcement-framework.md` for penalty tiers (up to €35M / 7% turnover) and enforcement risk in financial exposure assessments (especially for Management Briefing template)
