# EU AI Act Examination Report Generator — Deployment Guide

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

## Overview

EU AI Act Examination Report Generator — produces a formal, structured AI Act compliance assessment report suitable for legal files, audit trails, and regulatory inquiries:

- **9-section report structure** — introduction, system description, scope-exclusion check, scope of application, intended purpose, risk classification, applicable obligations, risk flags, conclusion
- **Context-first adaptive intake** — consumes prior skill outputs (classifier / roles / obligations / quick) when available
- **Input validation phase** — explicit Phase 1.5 to flag missing or inconsistent context before drafting
- **Citation-grounded prose** — legal citations index keeps article references consistent
- **Jurisdiction checklists** for Member-State-specific compliance items
- **Quality-check phase** before delivery (Phase 3)
- **Word document export** with formatted output (Phase 4)
- **Output templates** for assessment, gap analysis, regulator submission, and internal memo

## Deployment

### Claude.ai (User Skills)

1. Go to **Settings → Profile → Custom Skills** (or equivalent)
2. Upload the entire `ai-act-report/` folder structure
3. The skill will auto-trigger on "generate AI Act report", "Prüfbericht", "create compliance assessment", or "export as Word"

### Claude Code / Custom MCP Setup

1. Copy the `ai-act-report/` folder to your skills directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r ai-act-report/ /path/to/your/skills/user/ai-act-report/
   ```
2. Ensure the skill is registered in your configuration

## Usage

### Quick Start

Either start fresh or hand over context from prior skill output:

> "Generate a formal AI Act compliance report for our HR screening system.
> I've already run the classifier (high-risk, Annex III Nr. 4) and the roles
> skill (we're the deployer). Please assemble the full Prüfbericht and
> export it as a Word document."

The skill will validate the context, draft the 9-section report, run a quality check, and offer .docx export.

### Trigger Phrases

- "Generate AI Act report" / "Prüfbericht" / "Compliance assessment report"
- "Document the AI Act analysis" / "Export as Word"
- "Create a formal AI Act assessment"
