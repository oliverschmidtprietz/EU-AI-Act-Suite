# AI Act Output Templates

Three structured templates for AI Act compliance documentation, each serving a different audience and purpose. Templates integrate with the full 4-skill workflow and can be used in preliminary mode (from /ai-act-quick) or final mode (from /ai-act-report).

---

## When to Use Which Template

| Template | Audience | Purpose | When |
|----------|----------|---------|------|
| **1. Classification Record (Prüfprotokoll)** | Compliance team, legal counsel, auditors | Formal audit trail documenting the classification decision | After running /ai-act-classifier |
| **2. Compliance Register Entry** | GRC team, compliance officers, project managers | Living compliance tracking document per AI system | After running /ai-act-obligations |
| **3. Management Briefing (Entscheidungsvorlage)** | Board, C-level, senior management | Decision document requesting management action | When escalation or budget approval needed |

**Preliminary mode** (from /ai-act-quick): Mark all outputs as "PRELIMINARY — Full assessment recommended" and reduce detail level.

## Template 1: AI Act Classification Record (Prüfprotokoll)

### Purpose

Structured audit trail documenting the classification of an AI system under the EU AI Act. Designed for compliance files, regulatory inquiries, and internal audit. More rigorous than a summary memo — structured as a formal, versioned record with explicit reasoning for each determination.
