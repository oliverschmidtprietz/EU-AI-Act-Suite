### 6. Risk Classification

**6.1 Prohibited Practices Screening (Art. 5)**

| # | Category | Article | Applicable? | Reasoning |
|---|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Subliminal/manipulative/deceptive | Art. 5(1)(a) | No | System does not manipulate candidates or recruiters |
| 2 | Exploitation of vulnerabilities | Art. 5(1)(b) | No | No targeting based on age, disability, or economic situation |
| 3 | Social scoring | Art. 5(1)(c) | No | Not operated by or on behalf of public authority for social scoring |
| 4 | Criminal risk prediction | Art. 5(1)(d) | No | Not related to criminal risk assessment |
| 5 | Facial recognition scraping | Art. 5(1)(e) | No | No facial recognition database creation |
| 6 | Emotion recognition (workplace) | Art. 5(1)(f) | No | System analyzes CVs, not emotions. No video interview analysis component |
| 7 | Biometric categorization | Art. 5(1)(g) | No | No biometric data processing |
| 8 | Real-time biometric ID | Art. 5(1)(h) | No | No biometric identification |

**Result:** No prohibited practice identified.

**6.2 High-Risk Assessment**

**6.2.1 Annex I — Product Safety**
TalentMatch Pro is a standalone SaaS platform, not a component of a physical product and not covered by Annex I EU harmonization legislation.
**Result:** Not applicable.

**6.2.2 Annex III — Application-Based**

| # | Category | Applicable? | Sub-category | Reasoning |
|---|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Biometrics | No | — | No biometric processing |
| 2 | Critical infrastructure | No | — | HR is not critical infrastructure |
| 3 | Education & training | No | — | Not used in education context |
| 4 | Employment & workers | **Yes** | **Nr. 4(a)** | System intended for recruitment — screening and filtering applications, evaluating candidates |
| 5 | Essential services | No | — | Not credit, insurance, or emergency services |
| 6 | Law enforcement | No | — | Not law enforcement context |
| 7 | Migration & border | No | — | Not migration context |
| 8 | Justice & democracy | No | — | Not judicial or democratic process |

**Result:** Applicable — **Annex III Nr. 4(a)** (employment, workers management — recruitment)

**6.2.3 Art. 6(3) Exception Analysis**

| Condition | Assessment | Met? |
|---|---|---|
| (a) Narrow procedural task | System ranks and scores candidates based on multi-factor analysis — this is substantive, not narrow/procedural | No |
| (b) Improving completed human activity | Human has not yet made a decision — system precedes human assessment | No |
| (c) Detecting decision patterns | System generates new scores, does not analyze existing human decisions | No |
| (d) Preparatory task | System could be argued as preparatory — but it generates rankings that effectively pre-select candidates. The scoring materially influences which candidates are considered. | No (borderline) |

**Profiling re-exception check:** System evaluates personal aspects of individual natural persons (qualifications, experience, skills) → profiling under Art. 4(4) GDPR → **Art. 6(3) exception is independently blocked by profiling re-exception.**

**Result:** Exception does NOT apply — system is **HIGH-RISK** under Art. 6(2), Annex III Nr. 4(a).

## Sample 2: Non-High-Risk Art. 6(3) Documentation

### Context
AI system: "DocSort v2.1" — document categorization tool for incoming immigration applications.
Organization: ImmigrationTech BV (provider).
The system scans incoming applications, extracts key data fields (name, date, application type), and routes them to the correct department. It does NOT evaluate, rank, or assess applications.

---

### Art. 6(4) Non-High-Risk Assessment Documentation

**System name:** DocSort v2.1
**Version:** 2.1.3
**Provider:** ImmigrationTech BV (The Hague, Netherlands)
**Intended purpose:** Automated categorization and routing of incoming immigration applications based on document type and content extraction.
**Annex III category triggered:** Nr. 7(b) — AI for examination of applications relating to migration, asylum, and border control.
**Assessment date:** 12 January 2026
**Prepared by:** [Legal Counsel, ImmigrationTech BV]

**Art. 6(3) condition fulfilled: (a) — Narrow procedural task**

**Analysis:**
DocSort v2.1 performs a narrow, well-defined procedural task: it categorizes incoming documents by type (visa application, residence permit renewal, asylum claim, family reunification) and extracts structured data fields (applicant name, date of birth, application reference number, document type) for routing to the appropriate processing department.

The system:
- Performs document classification and data extraction ONLY
- Does NOT evaluate the merit, quality, or eligibility of any application
- Does NOT score, rank, or prioritize applicants
- Does NOT influence the substantive assessment of applications
- Could reasonably be performed by a simple classification algorithm (rule-based routing with OCR)

The task is procedural (sorting/routing) rather than substantive (evaluating/deciding). It is equivalent to a digital mailroom function.

**Significant Risk of Harm Assessment:**

| Question | Answer | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Can output affect health? | No | Document routing does not impact health |
| Can output affect safety? | No | Routing has no safety implications |
| Can output affect fundamental rights? | Low | Incorrect routing could delay processing, but human staff correct misrouted documents. System does not deny or grant applications. |
| Materially influence outcomes? | No | Application assessment is performed entirely by human officers after routing |
| Severity if errors? | Low | Misrouted document causes processing delay, not wrong decision |
| Persons affected? | High volume (thousands) but low impact per individual |

**Overall harm assessment:** No significant risk of harm identified. Errors result in processing delays that are correctable by human staff. The system does not materially influence application outcomes.

**Profiling Exclusion Confirmation:**

| Indicator | Present? | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Uses personal data | Yes | Extracts names, dates from applications |
| Evaluates personal aspects | **No** | System categorizes documents, not persons. Does not assess performance, reliability, behavior, etc. |
| Analyzes/predicts individual characteristics | **No** | Classification is based on document type, not individual attributes |
| Individual-level assessment | **No** | No assessment of individuals — only document classification |

**Profiling determination:** No profiling. System processes personal data for identification/routing purposes only, not for evaluating personal aspects of individuals.

**Registration:** Registered in EU database per Art. 49(2) — Reference: [EU-DB-2026-XXXXX]

**Conclusion:** DocSort v2.1 falls within Annex III Nr. 7(b) but qualifies for the Art. 6(3) exception under condition (a) — narrow procedural task. The system is classified as NOT high-risk. This documentation is maintained per Art. 6(4) and available to national competent authorities upon request.

## Sample 3: Minimal-Risk Chatbot Assessment

### Context
AI system: "ShopAssist" — e-commerce product recommendation chatbot.
Organization: RetailCo S.r.l. (deployer, Milan).
Provider: ChatBot Solutions Ltd (provider, Dublin).

---

### Abbreviated Assessment

**AI System Determination (Art. 3(1)):** YES — GPT-based conversational AI with inference capability, output generation, and environmental influence (recommendations affect purchase decisions).

**Risk Classification Summary:**

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| Art. 5 Prohibited Practices | None identified — product recommendations are not manipulative (transparent commercial context) |
| Annex I Product Safety | Not applicable — standalone software, not a product under Annex I legislation |
| Annex III Application-Based | Not applicable — e-commerce product recommendations do not fall under any Annex III category |
| Art. 6(3) Exception | N/A — no Annex III trigger to except from |
| GPAI | System uses GPAI model (GPT-based) — GPAI obligations fall on ChatBot Solutions Ltd as system provider integrating the GPAI model. OpenAI bears Art. 53 obligations as GPAI model provider. RetailCo as deployer: no GPAI-specific obligations |
| Art. 50 Transparency | **Art. 50(1) triggered** — system interacts directly with natural persons (chatbot) |
| Art. 50(2) | **Triggered** — system generates synthetic text content |

**Classification:** Minimal risk with Art. 50 transparency obligations.

**Applicable Obligations:**

| # | Obligation | Legal Basis | Responsible | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | AI interaction disclosure | Art. 50(1) | RetailCo (deployer) + ChatBot Solutions (provider) | Provider must design system for disclosure; deployer must ensure disclosure is active |
| 2 | Synthetic content marking | Art. 50(2) | ChatBot Solutions (provider) | Must implement machine-readable marking on generated text |
| 3 | AI competence | Art. 4 | Both provider and deployer | Train staff on AI system capabilities and limitations |

**Implementation Notes:**
- Art. 50(1): Add clear disclosure at start of chat interaction: "Sie kommunizieren mit einem KI-System / You are communicating with an AI system"
- Art. 50(2): Implement metadata tagging or watermarking on generated responses per Commission guidelines on AI-generated content marking
- Art. 4: Brief staff training for RetailCo customer service team on chatbot capabilities, limitations, and escalation procedures

**Key Flags:**
- Monitor for scope creep: if ShopAssist is later used for credit decisions, insurance recommendations, or employment-related tasks, reclassification would be required
- GPAI model updates: if the underlying GPT model is updated to a version with systemic risk (>10^25 FLOPs), GPAI obligations escalate
