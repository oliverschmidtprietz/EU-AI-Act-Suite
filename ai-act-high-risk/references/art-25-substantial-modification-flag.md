# Art. 25 substantial-modification flag

## Why this matters

Non-providers (distributors, importers, deployers, third parties) can become **providers** of a high-risk AI system — and inherit full Chapter III obligations — if any of three Art. 25(1) triggers fires.

## The three triggers (Art. 25(1))

### (a) Name/trademark on existing high-risk system

The actor puts their own name or trademark on a high-risk AI system already on the market.

Worked example: a SaaS reseller rebrands a third-party Annex III(4)(a) CV-screener as their own product → trigger (a).

Exception: contractual allocation of obligations between actors may shift duties; see Art. 25(2)–(4).

### (b) Substantial modification of an existing high-risk system

The actor makes a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system already on the market while it remains high-risk.

"Substantial modification" per Art. 3(23): a change to the AI system after its placing on the market or putting into service which is not foreseen in the provider's initial conformity assessment AND affects the system's compliance with Chapter III, OR results in a modification to the intended purpose.

Worked example: a hospital fine-tunes a medical-device AI on local patient data, changing its statistical behaviour beyond what the provider tested → trigger (b).

### (c) Modifying intended purpose so a non-high-risk system becomes high-risk

The actor modifies the intended purpose of any AI system — including a non-high-risk system or a GPAI system — such that it becomes high-risk under Art. 6.

Worked example: an enterprise deploys a general-purpose LLM with a new system prompt and integration to make recruiting decisions → trigger (c).

## What to do if a trigger fires

1. The actor becomes a **provider** under Art. 25(1).
2. Full Chapter III obligations apply (risk management, data governance, technical documentation, record keeping, transparency, human oversight, accuracy/robustness/cybersecurity, conformity assessment, registration, post-market monitoring, serious incident reporting).
3. Route to `ai-act-roles` for the full provider-determination workflow, then to `ai-act-obligations` for the obligation matrix.

## Forthcoming guidance

The Commission is preparing separate Guidelines on the practical application of rules for responsibilities along the AI value chain under Art. 25 (referenced in general-principles ¶14 footnote 6). When published, this file will be updated.
