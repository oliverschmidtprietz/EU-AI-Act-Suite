# ai-act-high-risk

Depth assessment skill for the **EU AI Act high-risk classification under Art. 6** (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689), grounded in the European Commission's draft Art. 6(5) classification guidelines (general principles, Annex I, Annex III) published for stakeholder consultation in 2026.

For the full classification workflow, see [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).
For version history, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## What this skill does

Given an AI system description and intended-purpose evidence, determines whether the system is high-risk under:

- **Art. 6(1) + Annex I** — AI system as product or safety component of a product under Union harmonisation legislation requiring third-party conformity assessment.
- **Art. 6(2) + Annex III** — AI system falling into one of eight high-risk use-case areas (biometrics, critical infrastructure, education, employment, essential services, law enforcement, migration, justice/democracy), subject to the Art. 6(3) exception filter and profiling re-exception.

Outputs a structured decision block + practitioner memo + JSON interchange artefact.

## Deployment

Place this skill in your Claude Code skill directory (`~/.claude/skills/` or workspace-level). Claude will route to it from `ai-act-classifier` automatically when a high-risk branch is triggered, or invoke it directly on user prompts mentioning Annex I / Annex III / Art. 6 classification.
