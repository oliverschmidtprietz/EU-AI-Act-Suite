## Deployment

### Claude.ai (User Skills)

1. Go to **Settings → Profile → Custom Skills** (or equivalent)
2. Upload the entire `ai-act-knowledge/` folder structure
3. The skill will auto-trigger when you ask about AI Act articles, requirements, penalties, GPAI obligations, FRIA, or any AI Act topic

### Claude Code / Custom MCP Setup

1. Copy the `ai-act-knowledge/` folder to your skills directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r ai-act-knowledge/ /path/to/your/skills/user/ai-act-knowledge/
   ```
2. Ensure the skill is registered in your configuration

## Usage

### Quick Start

Ask any AI Act question:

> "What does Art. 27 require for a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment, and
> when does it apply to deployers of high-risk systems?"

The skill will route to the right reference files and produce a cited answer.

### Trigger Phrases

- "Explain Art. X" / "What does Article X say?" / "AI Act requirements"
- "GPAI obligations" / "High-risk AI" / "Prohibited AI practices"
- "AI Act and GDPR" / "Fundamental rights impact assessment" / "AI literacy"
- "KI-Verordnung" / "Hochrisiko-KI" / "GPAI-Verhaltenskodex"

> For assessment workflows that produce a classification decision, use
> `ai-act-classifier` instead.
