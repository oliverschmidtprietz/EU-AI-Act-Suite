## Summary

- The EU AI Act covers AI systems used in employment decisions, including recruitment, selection, targeted job advertising, candidate evaluation, performance monitoring, and certain decisions about compliance, contract terms, or termination.
- Both providers and deployers of such AI systems are subject to obligations under the Act.
- Obligations include mandatory risk assessments, technical documentation, bias testing, human oversight, transparency disclosures, and continuous monitoring.
- The AI Act may apply to deployers even if they are not based in the European Union.
- The compliance deadline for staffing businesses is **2 August 2026**.
- The Act provides for national authorities' fining powers, as well as other enforcement powers such as the power to withdraw or recall AI systems from the market.
- Certain, but not all, AI systems deployed in the employment context may be exempt from obligations under the Act.

GDPR required businesses to rethink how they handle personal data. The EU AI Act requires them to rethink how they use the tools that process it.

## High-Risk Classification of Employment AI

Under the EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689), AI systems used in employment decisions fall into the high-risk category (Art. 6, Annex III). This covers:

- Recruitment and selection
- Targeted job advertising
- Candidate evaluation
- Performance monitoring
- Certain decisions about compliance, contract terms, or termination

Starting 2 August 2026, each of these tools requires mandatory risk assessments, technical documentation, bias testing, human oversight, transparency disclosures, and continuous monitoring.

## Why the Staffing Supply Chain Makes This Harder

Most commentary on the AI Act's employment provisions is written for in-house HR teams at single employers. That misses the reality for staffing businesses.

The typical staffing supply chain involves multiple AI touchpoints:

- A **Vendor Management System (VMS)** platform uses algorithmic matching to surface candidates
- A **Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO)** provider runs AI-powered screening across thousands of applicants
- A **staffing agency** deploys chatbot pre-qualification
- An **Employer of Record (EOR)** uses AI for onboarding, compliance, termination, and performance across multiple jurisdictions

At every stage, AI systems are making or influencing decisions about people's livelihoods, and the Act's obligations for deployers do not distinguish between entities in the chain based on who owns the technology.

### Deployer Definition

Under Article 3, a "deployer" is any natural or legal person using an AI system under its authority. If a staffing firm selects, configures, or relies on an AI tool to inform workforce decisions, it is a deployer — even if it did not build the technology and even if the platform vendor claims compliance is their responsibility. The Act assigns obligations to both providers (vendors who build the systems) and deployers (businesses that use them). Compliance obligations cannot be passed to a technology partner.

## Extraterritorial Reach

The Act has extraterritorial reach. If the output of an AI system is used in the EU or affects persons located in the Union (a candidate screened for a role in Berlin, a contractor evaluated in Dublin, a temp worker matched to an assignment in Amsterdam), the regulation applies regardless of where the company is headquartered or where the technology is hosted.

## Key Obligations for Staffing Businesses

### Human Oversight

Every high-risk AI system must be used in a way that allows effective human oversight. No AI tool should make final placement, rejection, or evaluation decisions without a qualified human in the loop. Recruiters and account managers need to understand how the system works, what its limitations are, and when to override its outputs.

Article 14 requires the people exercising oversight to detect and correct errors, including discriminatory patterns. A policy document alone does not satisfy this.

### Transparency and Notification

Before deploying a high-risk AI system, Article 26(7) requires deployers to inform workers' representatives and affected workers. In staffing, this extends to candidates and contingent workers. They have a right to know that AI is being used, how it functions, and what role it plays in decisions that affect them.

Under Article 86, individuals subject to decisions made by high-risk AI systems can request an explanation of the main factors behind those decisions. For high-volume recruitment, the disclosure process needs to be operational and visible, not buried in terms-of-service documents.

### Data Quality and Bias Monitoring

If deployers exercise control over input data fed into high-risk AI systems, they must ensure data is relevant and representative. Staffing agencies, where candidate pools are often skewed by geography, language, or existing network effects, face a particularly substantive version of this obligation. Businesses need to know what data their AI tools are trained on, how they handle protected characteristics, and whether they produce equitable outcomes across demographics.

### Logging and Documentation

Deployers must keep logs generated by high-risk AI systems for at least six months. Combined with the requirement to monitor system performance on an ongoing basis, this creates an operational infrastructure need that many staffing businesses have not yet scoped.

## Timeline

The Act entered into force on 1 August 2024. Key dates:

- **February 2025:** Some AI practices are prohibited, including biometric categorisation and emotion recognition in the workplace (with some excluded use cases). AI literacy obligations became effective.
- **2 August 2026:** Full suite of high-risk system obligations becomes enforceable for Annex III systems, including all employment-related AI.

Some industry commentary has suggested that the European Commission's Digital Omnibus package (proposed November 2025) will push this deadline back. However, this is a proposal, not enacted law, and must pass through Parliament and Council.

## Penalty Framework

The Act's enforcement follows a tiered model:

| Violation | Maximum Fine |
|---|---|
| Failure to meet high-risk system obligations | EUR 15 million or 3% of global annual turnover (whichever is higher) |
| Use of prohibited AI practices | EUR 35 million or 7% of turnover |
| Providing incorrect or misleading information to regulators | EUR 7.5 million or 1% of turnover |

National market surveillance authorities, not a single EU-wide regulator, handle enforcement. In January 2026, Finland became the first member state to confer enforcement powers on its market surveillance authority pursuant to Article 99. Other member states are following. This decentralised model means enforcement priorities and interpretive approaches may differ across member states, creating planning challenges for multi-country staffing operations.

Beyond fines, regulators also have the power to withdraw or recall non-compliant AI systems from the market. For a staffing business whose operating model depends on technology-enabled matching and screening, this is the more commercially significant risk: a core tool pulled mid-contract with immediate operational disruption.

## Exemptions Under Article 6(3)

Article 6(3) sets out four conditions under which an AI system used in an employment context might fall outside the high-risk classification, even though it operates in a high-risk area:

1. The system performs a **narrow procedural task** (e.g., sorting documents into categories, flagging duplicates)
2. The system **improves the result of a previously completed human activity** (e.g., cleaning up language in a drafted contract)
3. The system **detects patterns in prior human decisions** (e.g., flagging inconsistencies in past performance ratings)
4. The system performs a **purely preparatory task** (indexing, searching, or translating source material before a human decision)

### The Profiling Exception

Article 6(3), read together with Recital 53, explicitly states that none of those exemptions apply if the AI system involves **profiling** within the meaning of Article 4(4) GDPR. Profiling means any automated processing of personal data that evaluates personal aspects of an individual, including analysing or predicting work performance, reliability, behaviour, or location.

Most candidate matching tools, ranking algorithms, and workforce allocation systems do exactly that: they take personal data, apply automated logic, and produce predictions about suitability or fit. That is profiling, and it renders the exemption unavailable in these cases.

**Practical implication:** When running an AI inventory and classifying systems, the Article 6(3) exemptions may apply to tools handling procedural or preparatory tasks. For anything that matches, ranks, evaluates, or allocates workers based on personal characteristics, the exemptions almost certainly do not apply.

## Competitive Implications

The EU AI Act is a market-shaping event that will separate operationally mature staffing businesses from those running on unexamined technology.

- Enterprise clients with EU operations, particularly in regulated industries, are already building AI governance into vendor selection criteria.
- Staffing businesses that can demonstrate compliant AI practices, transparent candidate processes, and documented oversight frameworks will have a measurable advantage in RFPs and preferred supplier negotiations.
- The EU AI Act is the first major AI regulation of its kind, but similar frameworks are taking shape in the UK, Canada, South Korea, Brazil, Taiwan, and at state level in the US. Investing in AI governance infrastructure now builds capacity that transfers across jurisdictions.

## Practical Compliance Steps

1. **Map every AI system** that touches candidate or worker decisions: screening, matching, ranking, chatbots, performance analytics, scheduling algorithms. Include tools embedded in third-party platforms. Compliance is impossible for obligations the business does not know it has.

2. **Classify each tool:** Determine whether the business is the deployer, whether the system falls within Annex III's employment category, and who the provider is. Document this in a way compliance and operations teams can work from.

3. **Engage AI vendors:** Ask specific questions: Are they aware of the EU AI Act? Are they pursuing conformity assessment? Can they provide technical documentation, bias audit results, and usage logs? Will they contractually commit to supporting deployer obligations?

4. **Assign oversight responsibility:** Identify who in the organisation will oversee each high-risk AI system. Ensure those people have the training and authority to understand, monitor, and override AI outputs. Document the process. AI literacy obligations are already in effect.

5. **Draft notifications and disclosures:** Prepare the notification, disclosure, and explanation frameworks needed to inform candidates and workers about AI use. In a labour market where candidate experience drives placement volume, transparency is a differentiator, not a burden.
